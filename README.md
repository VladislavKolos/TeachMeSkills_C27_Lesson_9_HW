Homework for the ninth lesson

1. **task1** there is a class hierarchy. Abstract sealed class "Figure" with field "name" and constructor with one parameter. Mandatory abstract methods have been created for calculating the area of ​​a figure, the perimeter of a figure and displaying information. These methods are extended into the generated final classes "Triangle", "Rectangle" and "Circle". Fields "sideH", "height", "sideFirst" and "sideSecond" are created in the class "Triangle" and a constructor with five parameters is created. Fields "length" and "width" are created in the class "Rectangle" and a constructor with three parameters is created. Field "radius" is created in the class "Circle" and a constructor with two parameters is created. There is an interface "Const" for storing constants. This interface stores a PI constant with the value 3.14159. Operations are performed, objects are created, methods are called in the new class "Runner".

2. **task2** there is a class "Utils". In this class there is a static method "displayArray" for displaying the array on the screen using "System.out.println". The method takes a two-dimensional array as input. The static method "displayArray" is used three times: outputting the first array, outputting the second array and outputting the result of multiplying two arrays. The class "Utils" also contains a method "multiplicationArray" for multiplying two arrays. Arrays are declared and initialized, methods are called and checks are written in the class "Runner".
